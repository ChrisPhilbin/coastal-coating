        Coastal Coating started with one goal in mind â€“ To bring the Grand
        Strand affordable, high quality ceramic coatings to protect our cars,
        boats, RVs, motorcycles, and more from the harsh elements of our area
        and beach life.<br /><br />
        Coating opened in March 2019 and has currently protected over 250
        vehicles in our area. We have grown to a team of 4 dedicated ceramic
        coating specialists who live and breath cars. We are trusted by multiple
        dealerships and businesses in the Grand Strand as well as sponsor 3
        local non-profit organizations: Myrtle Beach Car Club, Myrtle Beach
        Corvette Club, and Coastal Carolina Mustang Club.
